# Parallel-Data-Compression
An optimisation of the lossless data compression algorithm I worked on before, running it in a parallel environment. 

It includes an implementation of the newly developed algorithm (VaFLE) as well as the Run Length Encoding algorithm, done both in a serial as well as parallel environment using the OpenMP API in C++. 

This project was performed only to compare performance of both the compression algorithms, in terms of compression rate as well as time efficiency in both serial and parallel environments.

A research paper was written and published in the Springer CCIS book series (Vol. 1025). This research paper has been added in the repository for any further reference on the analysis of the algorithm, and the experiments conducted.
