# Parallel-Data-Compression
An optimisation of the lossless data compression algorithm I worked on before, running it in a parallel environment. 

It includes an implementation of the newly developed algorithm (VaFLE) as well as the Run Length Encoding algorithm, done both in a serial as well as parallel environment using the OpenMP API in C++. 

This project was performed only to compare performance of both the compression algorithms, in terms of compression rate as well as time efficiency in both serial and parallel environments.
